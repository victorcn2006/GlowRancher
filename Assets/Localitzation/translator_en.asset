    m_Localized: 'At the faraway Slime Ranch, Pink Slime was one of the first slimes
      to appear. Her bright pink color and adorable shape made her everyone''s favorite,
      and the best part was that she was always hopping around!

      

      One
      day, Pink Slime discovered a field full of fresh fruit and started eating it.
      The taste was so delicious that it made her body even brighter and her jumps
      even higher! Thanks to her ability to jump so high, Pink Slime helped the new
      slimes reach the highest spots and gather fruit for everyone.

      

      Over
      time, Pink Slime became the first slime on the ranch that the caretakers knew,
      always cheerful and ready to share her positive energy. Her ability to make
      everything more fun made her the most beloved of all.'

    m_Localized: Corrupton is a mischievous and eccentric slime in Slime Rancher,
      known for his ability to tamper with technological systems. Instead of feeding
      on fruits or vegetables like other slimes, Corrupton consumes code and alters
      the ranch's devices, creating chaos and fun in his wake. His greatest achievement
      was transforming the ranch into a music and light festival, where all the slimes
      could enjoy some controlled mayhem. Despite his pranks, Corrupton has become
      something of an official DJ for the ranch, bringing color and celebration to
      the lives of Beatrix and her slimes.
